# Contributing
To get started, fork the repository to your account and then clone your fork to your local machine.

You can now start working on the project, but before you do, here are some general guidelines that will make contributing a lot easier:
- if you wish to work on some major new feature, it's usually a good idea to open an issue first, so that it can be discussed
- when writing code, make sure that the code you write is formatted in the same way that everything else is formatted.
- if you are writing some new code that is not covered by the tests, try to write tests for it too
- before committing your changes make sure that the project builds correctly and that the tests are passing
- don't forget to add your name and your email (and some information about the file if it's new) address to the comments in the head of files

After you're done working on your changes, commit your work and push it to your fork.

You can then open a pull request from your fork to the upstream repository. After the pull request is made, we will comment / review it and might also suggest some changes. After all that is done, the pull request is merged.

## How to contribute
You can contribute in many ways:
- fix some bugs
- add some new cool features
- open a new issue if you have a new idea, or you've found a bug and there is no issue for it
